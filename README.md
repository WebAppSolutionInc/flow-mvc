# FlowMVC

# Goals 

This port demonstrates the following:

*  Separation-of-concerns for Model-View-Controller-Service
*  Dependency injection of services and stores using DeftJS
*  Application-Level event bus communication
*  Services as mocks and real HTTP data services
*  Rigorous elimination of logic from View code using Mediators
*  Localization of all copy via a Runtime-enabled LocaleManager
*  Unit Tests using Jasmine for both functional and asynchronous code blocks [In Progress]
*  Ability to use services with Asynchronous Tokens or DeftJS Promises
*  Extensive reuse and portability of application and business objects by the ExtJS and Touch versions; only views and
mediators differ
*  Lazy loading of data services (*with auto-jsonify of external JSON data*)
*  Code versions handwritten in Javascript with extensive class and method level comments with JSDuck Documentation
