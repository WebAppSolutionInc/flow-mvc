### [WASI's](http://www.webappsolution.com) FlowMVC

FlowMVC builds on the work of DeftJS, Sencha's ExtJS, and Sencha Touch APIs with extensions that enable Flex and
ActionScript developers to take their expertise and apply them to the HTML5/JavaScript world. It's a framework that
users of Flex MVC-based architectures, such as Parley or Swiz, will be familiar with.

In addition, for enterprises looking to leverage intellectual capital across platforms with Sencha Touch and ExtJS, it
provides an application structure with reusability and portability in mind encouraging the re-use of application and
business logic.

For enterprises struggling with the myriad of choices available, FlowMVC and the tools used in the demo project,
provide a level of security for enterprise architects and managers that their goals, such as well defined project
structure, documentation, testability, localization, and re-use of resources, both human and IC, are met.

**FlowMVC works with ExtJS version 4.1 and up, Sencha Touch version 2.0 and up, and DeftJS version 0.8.0 and up.**

## Goals

* **Familiarity**: Provides constructs and patterns familiar to users of Flex MVC-based architectures.
* **Consistent Project Structure**: Builds on the prescriptive nature of Sencha MVC and DeftJS.
* **Testability**: Promotes the use of Passive Views and Mediators to facilitate wide coverage per
[Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html).
* **Reusability**: Provides further facilitation to the re-use of IC between Sencha Touch and Sencha ExtJS code bases.
